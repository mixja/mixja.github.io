## Introduction

Welcome to Part 3 of this six part series on building an EAP-SIM demo.

### Prerequisites

See here for prerequisites.

## Install your SIM Card Reader drivers

I'm using an [OmniKey 6121 v2](http://www.hidglobal.com/products/readers/omnikey/6121) reader but any reader should be fine, as long as you have drivers available for your operating system.

The Omnikey 6121 OS X drivers are availble for download [here](http://www.hidglobal.com/drivers/14965) and installation will require a reboot:

## Install Python and Swig.

The tools I am going to use are Python-based, so you need to ensure you have Python installed.  

Although Python ships with OS X, I prefer to use the most up-to-date versions of Python, which you can install using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

{% highlight console %}
$ brew install python
==> Installing dependencies for python: readline, sqlite, gdbm
==> Installing python dependency: readline
...
...
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.10_2: 4866 files, 76M
{% endhighlight %}

We also need to install [Swig](http://swig.org), which is a library that provides bindings from languages such as Python into C/C++ applications.  Swig is required to install pyscard.

 {% highlight console %}
 $ brew install swig
==> Installing swig dependency: pcre
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/pcre-8.37.yosemite.bottle.t

==> Installing swig
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/swig-3.0.7.yosemite.bottle.
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring swig-3.0.7.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/swig/3.0.7: 729 files, 7.1M

## Install Pyscard

Pyscard is a Python module that provides smart card support for Python applications.

For my environment, Pyscard 1.6.16 only seems to work - there is a later version of Pyscard available (1.9.0) but this 
The pysim library that we will install later only seems to work
